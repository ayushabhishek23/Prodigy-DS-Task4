# Prodigy InfoTech Internship — Task 3: Decision Tree Classifier
Welcome to my Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship repository!  
This repository contains **Task 4**, which focuses on analyzing sentiment patterns in social media text data to understand public opinions and emotional tone using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

---

## 📌 Task Overview
The objective of this task is to analyze and visualize sentiment patterns from Twitter text data to classify emotions such as positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. 
This task uses Twitter training and validation datasets containing labeled tweet text used for supervised sentiment learning.
